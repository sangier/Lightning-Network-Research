Forwarding HTLCs

In general, a node offers HTLCs for two reasons: to initiate a payment of its own, or to forward another node's payment. 
In the forwarding case, care must be taken to ensure the outgoing HTLC cannot be redeemed unless the incoming HTLC can be redeemed. The following requirements ensure this is always true.

The respective addition/removal of an HTLC is considered irrevocably committed when:

    The commitment transaction with/without it is committed to by both nodes, and any previous commitment transaction without/with it has been revoked, OR
    The commitment transaction with/without it has been irreversibly committed to the blockchain.


The route is constructed by the origin node, which knows the public keys of each intermediate node and of the final node.

An HTLCs can be broadcasted onto bitcoin network
Now, everyone can clear out, because they have a guaranteed way to pull their deserved funds by broadcasting these HTLCs onto Bitcoinâ€™s network (i.e. on-chain). 
They would prefer not to do that though, since broadcasting on-chain is more expensive, and instead settle each of these hops off chain
