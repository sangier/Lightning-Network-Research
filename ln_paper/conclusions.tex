The Lightning network is still in its infancy in terms of usage. 
We have presented a simple methodology to measure the current capacity of a Lightning channel. 

For future work, we consider improving the methodology to measure channels that are not directly connected to the nodes the measurement node attaches to. In this way we could increase the number of channels that could be characterized, without increasing the cost of the experiment (resulting from the transactions in the blockchain required to establish and removing the measurement channel) and the time to perform the experiment (a large component is the time required to ensure consensus on the blockchain transaction used to open and close the channel). 

Besides increasing the number of measured channels, we are also interested in capturing the evolution of the capacities overtime. 
As we have noted, capacity measurement does not provide enough information to evaluate the amount of value that circulates over the network, as it only shows the current balance, but not the steps followed to reach to that balance.
By taking different snapshots over varying periods of time we aim to gather more information about the (now elusive) flow of currency across Lightning.
